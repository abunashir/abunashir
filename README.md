Software Engineer with 8+ years of development experience including leading the
development of a successful travel startup. Iâ€™m passionate about engineering,
data, and people.

In the past, I have worked as a full-stack developer, mobile application
developer, and also technical lead for multiple companies.

Currently, I'm working at trivago in the core product team. I'm mainly working
with the leads and product owners to identify the business needs, then work
closely with the team to put those initiatives into production.

If you are interested in working with me, talk about technology or just to
connect then please feel free to get in touch!
